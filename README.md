__Final Project Year Project__

    By: Gaurav Pratap Singh (18CSU072)


made using OpenGL and C++

To compile the project you can use VS 2022

You also have to link GLFW, Glew, GLM, Assimp and ImGUI

Glew:
http://glew.sourceforge.net/

GLFW:
https://www.glfw.org/

GLM:
https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html

Assimp:
https://github.com/assimp/assimp

ImGUI:
https://github.com/ocornut/imgui

Once you have linked the libraries, you can compile the project by opening the solution file in Visual Studio and pressing F5.

The project includes a simple example game that demonstrates the use of the engine. The game allows you to move a camera around a scene that contains a few 3D models.

The engine is designed to be modular and extensible. It is possible to add new features and functionality by creating new classes and modules.

The engine is also designed to be portable. It can be compiled and run on Windows Platform

I hope you enjoy using this engine!
